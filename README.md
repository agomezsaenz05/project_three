## Project Proposal
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in EMS response times in NYC boroughs. We’ll examine relationships between response time v. income, response time between Feb 22, 2020 - Apr 22, 2020, response time v. initial severity level reported.

- The questions we’ll ask of the data
    - How EMS response times compare between high and low income neighborhoods
    - How EMS response times compare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
    - How EMS response times compare between the initial severity levels reported (by dispatcher)
- Sources for the data 
    -  EMS Response Times in NYC dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/ny-ems-incident-dispatch-data
    -  Average incomes in NCY: https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/table/66/median-incomes#66/107/127/a/a
    -  Note: EMS dataset file was too big to upload to github. Please refer to above link.
