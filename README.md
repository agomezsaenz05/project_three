## Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).
    - We are using MongoDB
    -
2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:

    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

## Project Proposal
The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)
    - EMS Response times in NYC boroughs
    - 
- The questions you’ll ask of the data
    - How EMS response times compare between high and low income neighborhoods
    - How EMS response times compare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
    - How EMS response times compare between the initial severity levels reported (by dispatcher)
- Sources for the data
    -  EMS Response Times in NYC dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/ny-ems-incident-dispatch-data
    -  Average incomes in NCY: https://data.cccnewyork.org/data/table/66/median-incomes#66/107/127/a/a

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in EMS response times in NYC boroughs. We’ll examine relationships between response time v. high/low income, response time between Jan 01, 2020 - Mar 31, 2020, response time v. initial severity level reported.
