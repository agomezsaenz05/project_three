## Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group to tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2. Your project should fall into one of the following three tracks:

    - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

    - A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data

    - A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

3. Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4. Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5. Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns, textboxes).

6. Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

## Project Proposal
The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)

- The questions you’ll ask of the data

- Possible source for the data

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships >between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over >the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.
